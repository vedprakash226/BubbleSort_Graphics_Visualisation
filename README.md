# BubbleSort_Graphics_Visualizer

After running this code it firstly generates random data ranges between 1 to len.
It will prints the data as the height of the line in the graphics window.

While sorting algorithm is under process, if the two numbers represented by lines are in the wrong order, then one of the line will marked as Red and other as yellow. They will then disappeared for short while and then the correct order of the lines are printed on the window and also the data in the array is swapped.

This helps in the visualization of the sorting algorithm.
